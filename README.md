A Python data analysis project exploring credit risk behaviors across income, utilization, and customer segments. Includes visualizations, segmentation, and insights used in fintech analytics.

**Credit Risk EDA**

This project analyzes a synthetic credit risk dataset to understand customer financial behavior and identify key drivers of loan default. The analysis explores income, utilization, delinquencies, spending patterns, and customer segments commonly used in fintech and credit underwriting.

**Project Goals**

- Explore customer demographics and financial behavior
- Understand which factors drive higher default risk
- Compare risk across income, utilization, and spending segments
- Identify differences between defaulters and non-defaulters
- Build a foundation for future credit risk modeling

**Data Preparation**

- Loaded dataset and inspected schema
- Checked for nulls and removed missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Summarized numeric + categorical variables



**Exploratory Analysis (EDA)**

Key visualizations include:

Age Distribution
Income Distribution
Utilization Rate Distribution
Correlation Heatmap

These plots give a high-level understanding of portfolio behavior


**Segmentation & Default Analysis**

**Default rates were analyzed across:
**
- Income Bins (quantiles)
  Default decreases as income increases — classic risk pattern.

- Utilization Bins
  Customers above 80% utilization show the highest default rates.

- Spend Segments & Education Levels
  Segments show meaningful differences in income and risk behavior.

- Income Segments (Low, Mid, Upper Mid, High)
  Clear monotonic decline in default risk from Low → High.

**Defaulters vs Non-Defaulters
**
A comparison of average behaviors shows that defaulters typically:

- Earn less income
- Have higher utilization
- Have more delinquencies
- Have more recent inquiries

These are standard predictors in credit risk modeling.


Key Insights Summary

- Income and utilization are strong drivers of default risk.
- Customers using >80% of their credit lines show ~20% default rates.
- Delinquencies and credit inquiries sharply differentiate risky customers.
- Spend and education segments help explain behavior and targeting opportunities.

Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
